# Assignment:
# 1. Build a command line Chess game where 
#    two players can play against each other.
# 2. The game should be properly constrained 
#    â€“ it should prevent players from making 
#      illegal moves and declare check or 
#      check mate in the correct situations.
# 3. Make it so you can save the board at 
#    any time.
# 4. Write tests for the important parts.
# 5. Do your best to keep your classes modular 
#    and clean and your methods doing only one 
#    thing each.

# ###############  High-level game overview:
# - Game between two players playing 
#   alternatively.

# - Board class initialized with the expected
#   pieces.
# - Somehow pieces will have to be black and
#   white and so must - in some manner - also
#   the chessboard squares be.

# - There ought to be a class for each type
#   of piece: rook, bishop, queen, king, ...


# - Input from users will be limited to 
#   the reference to two positions, the 
#   position of the piece to be moved and the
#   desired position of that same piece.
# - Somehow each user input will have to be
#   verified. It might not be valid.
# - Not only ought each user input be 
#   verified to be valid, but it ought also
#   be verified whether or not such a move
#   "takes" an opponent's chess piece.
# - Must not forget: taking en-passant and
#   castling.

# Must also not forget: 
# - Check and checkmate evaluations; 
# - Possibilty to quit at any time;
# - Proposition of a draw after a move made.
# - Draw claim through repetition of moves.
# - Exchange of pieces when other end of 
#   board is reached.


# Let's tackle the game board display.

# Chess symbols listed at
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode
# output symbols with very small dimensions.
# One can always play with an enlarged version of
# the command line... But even then... it's small.

# Possible black square: "\u25FB"
# Possible white sqaure: "\u25FC"
# Though, in fact, the display in irb suggests
# the contrary.

# Another possibility would be to display
# each chess piece preceded by the initial
# of its corresponding colour's name and 
# let each empty square either be empty as 
# in an empty grid or be filled with the 
# respective coordinates.

############### 4 May ######################

# Let's try and use connect-four-tdd files
# to get a basic sketch of the chess game.

# How ought the various chess pieces be
# treated?

# - In the end they ought to have an
#   instance variable for the respective
#   symbol.
# - Ought they all to derive from one class,
# ChessPiece class?
# - Ought they to have an instance variable
# for its possible moves?

# In the end, if thinking this through
# correctly, user input will be as simple
# as the location of the piece to be moved
# with the final desired destination location.
# Something in the lines of 2a-3a, for example.

# Under the hood:
# There will have to be an update_board method
# that verifies that move desired by user
# is valid and changes the board and the
# board display accordingly.

# The verification that a desired move by a user
# is valid could perhaps be made interrogating
# the respetive piece's node whether that
# desired move is included in an instance
# variable which would countain its
# possible moves.

# Two ways to arrange things present themselves:
# 1. Piece class to be initialized with symbol
#    and possible_moves as instance variables.
#    Bishop, rook, pawn, queen, knight classes
#    inherit from Piece class but fill
#    possible_moves instance variables with
#    respective methods.
# 2. Do away with Piece superclass and just 
#    create the various chess pieces' classes
#    separately.

# There really doesn't seem to be a need for
# there to be a chess piece superclass...
# At least at the moment...

# Besides what would this inherit framework
# look like?

# class ChessPiece ; end

# class King < ChessPiece
#   attr_reader :symbol
#   def initialize(symbol)
#     @symbol = symbol
#   end

#   def possible_moves
#     ["hello"]
#   end
# end

# king = King.new("\u2654")
# p king.possible_moves
# p king.symbol

# As of right now, something that doesn't
# seem all that useful, specially if
# it means what was above layed out.

# A class for each ChessPiece is to be then.

# Does each ChessPiece class need an
# instance variable for its position?

# #possible_moves, currently associated with
# each ChessPiece class, will more than likely
# need the location of the respective piece
# and the current state of the board.

# So a location instance variable associated
# with each ChessPiece variable may make things
# easier for the possible_moves method.

# Class for each ChessPiece will then have
# as instance variables: location and symbol.
# Possible moves can perhaps remain a method.

# Location ought to have a setter method, as it
# ought to be able to change.
# Symbol can perhaps only have a getter method.

# Example:

# class King
#   attr_accessor :location
#   attr_reader :symbol
#   def initialize(symbol, location)
#     @symbol = symbol
#     @location = location
#   end

#   def possible_moves

#   end
# end

# king = King.new("\u2654", "e1")

# p king.symbol
# p king.location

# Now a decision has to be made on what
# type of values ought to be passed to
# each class' location instance variable.

# Whether the board cell index or the
# "letter + number" notation.

# Be it as it may, a conversion is possible
# between the two:

# cell = row * 8 - (8 - column)
# cell = number * 8 -(8 - letter)

# columns = {a: 0, b: 1, c: 2, d: 3,
#              e: 4, f: 5, g: 6, h: 7}

# e.g. e1 == 1 * 8 - (8 - 4) == 4, cell[4]


# As regards the intialization of each
# chess piece class instance the concrete
# manner of filling out the location
# instance variable doesn't seem to favour
# any one side more than the other...

# Where it might be relevant is in regard to:
# 1. Changing the location instance variable
#    due to user input.
#    If notation is used to set location
#    instance variable its update wouldn't
#    have to rely on a translation of the user
#    user input.
# 2. Calculation of the possible moves.
#    On connect-four-tdd project the relation
#    between certain squares of the board and
#    others was explored using board indexes.
#    Would the exploration of the chess board
#    - required, at least to some extent, for
#    each piece on the board - have to rely
#    on a permanent translation of every chess
#    board position/index to a notation value?
#    If so and in a glance, this seems to imply
#    much more translation than the mere
#    translation of user input.

# Let's assume the mistake: location instance
# variable to be defined in the notation terms
# previously exemplified: [a-h][1-8].
# Possible moves method ought to translate
# notation value into cell index and explore
# its relation to other chess board squares
# in that manner: comparing board indexes.

# In connect-four-tdd a problem arose: that of
# "wrapping children"; that is, the relation
# between indexes of end-of-row and beggining-
# -of-new-row.
# Would that be avoided in using notation
# instead of cell indexes?
# From a far-sighted perspective, it seems not.

# How would the relation between chess board
# squares be explored in notation terms?
# In the same manner, it seems, as when
# board indexes are used. Only the possible
# changes, the possible moves would be expressed
# as variations in rows [1-8] and in columns [a-h].

# Only variations in columns would not be obtained,
# at least directly, through an arithmetic operation
# such as the addition or subraction of x units.
# To be sure that could be made if an array of [a-h]
# was created where "a" would stand for 0 and "h" for 7.

# Let us take a concrete example and examine the
# different possibilities.

# Let us take a king at cell[33]. King's possible
# moves would be:

# 34,             # 41, 42,               # 25, 26

# However, generally, a king would admit the moves
# derived from the addition of the following numbers:

# vars = [-1, 1, 8, -8, 9, -9, 7, -7]

# As was identified not all those variations should
# actually be counted as possible for a king at
# cells[33].
# As was done in connect-four-tdd this problem could
# be solved by introducing a guard clause.

# However the question that is now being explored
# is whether or not this problem would not arise
# if the notation previously defined ([a-h][1-8])
# was used to define the changes that could result
# in the possible moves for a given chess piece.

# Let us again consider a king at cells[33], that is
# at h5. King's possible moves would be:

# g5,             # g6, h6,               # g4, h4

# The question then now is how could one obtain
# the king's possible moves in notation terms?

# Formally:
# row_vars = [1, 0, -1]
# column_vars = [1, 0, -1]

# Kings possible moves would be expressed through a
# nested loop covering each element of the two arrays
# identified.

# Notation columns could be translated into numbers
# for that purpose.
# Directly, using a hash as the one downbelow:
# columns = {a: 0, b: 1, c: 2, d: 3,
#              e: 4, f: 5, g: 6, h: 7}

# Or perhaps more usefully, in reference to an ordered
# data structure such as an array. Where the letter's
# index would correspond to its actual value. As
# shown below:
# columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
# columns[0] = a
# columns[1] = b

# Given this framework how could one translate a notation
# value into something that could be used to attain its
# possible moves?

# Using the coordinates h5.
# columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
# row_vars = [1, 0, -1]
# column_vars = [1, 0, -1]
# coordinates_notation = "h5"

# coordinates = coordinates_notation.split("")      #== ["h", "5"]
# column = columns.index(coordinates[0])            #== 7
# row = coordinates[1].to_i                         #== 5
# coordinates = [column, row]

# possible_moves = []
# for i in column_vars do
#   for j in row_vars do
#     possible_moves << [coordinates[0] + i, coordinates[1] + j] unless i == 0 && j == 0
#   end
# end

# possible_moves    #== [[8, 6], [8, 5], [8, 4], [7, 6], [7, 5], [7, 4], [6, 6], [6, 5], [6, 4]]

# possible_moves = possible_moves.map { |coordinates| [columns[coordinates[0]], coordinates[1]].join}

#         #== ["6", "5", "4", "h6", "h5", "h4", "g6", "g5", "g4"]

# possible_moves = possible_moves.select { |coordinates| coordinates.length == 2 }

#         #== ["h6", "h4", "g6", "g5", "g4"]


# And how would one obtain king's possible
# moves using its cell index? 

# As said above, generally, a king would admit the moves
# derived from the addition of the following numbers:

# vars = [-1, 1, 8, -8, 9, -9, 7, -7]

# However, safeguard conditions have to be put in place
# of when king would be at the first column or at the 
# last column.

# last_column_idxs = [1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57]
# first_column_idxs = [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64]

# Will not work with king on last column (h):
# -1, -9, 7

# Will not work with king on first column (a):
# 1, 9, -7

# vars_last_column = [ 1, 8, -8, 9, -7]
# vars_first_column = [-1, 8, -8, -9, 7]

# Let us take a king at cells[33]

# coordinates = 33

# def possible_moves(idx)
#   possible_moves = []

#   last_column_idxs = [1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57]
#   first_column_idxs = [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64]

#   vars = [-1, 1, 8, -8, 9, -9, 7, -7]
#   vars_last_column = [ 1, 8, -8, 9, -7]
#   vars_first_column = [-1, 8, -8, -9, 7]

#   if last_column_idxs.include?(idx)
#     vars_last_column.each do |value|
#       possible_moves << idx + value
#     end
#   elsif first_column_idxs.include?(idx)
#     vars_first_column.each do |value|
#       possible_moves << idx + value
#     end
#   else
#     vars.each do |value|
#       possible_moves << idx + value
#     end
#   end
#   possible_moves
# end

# possible_moves(33)  #==[34, 41, 25, 42, 26]

# Must not forget however that user input
# will be in notation. A conversion of the
# notation value into index will, thus, be
# needed.

######### Conversion from notation to index:
# cell == number * 8 -(8 - letter)

######### Conversion from index to notation:
# columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
# if cell % 8 != 0
#   number = (cell / 8) + 1
#   columns[8 - (cell % 8)]
# else
#   number = cell % 8
#   letter = a


############### 6 May ######################

# Problem being tackled was:
# - Articulation between user input and
#   possible_moves method inherent to each
#   chess piece class.

# The fundamental question was on which terms
# ought the location instance variable inherent
# to each chess piece class be defined: either
# in notation terms or in indexes terms.

# And a train of thought was constructed
# focusing on the articulation between the
# location instance variable and the method
# possible_moves.

# Two different possible implementations
# of possible_moves were sketched out.

########################
########## Possibility 1 for possible_moves:
# [Using notation terms as input and output.]

# def possible_moves(coordinates_notation)
#   columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
#   row_vars = [1, 0, -1]
#   column_vars = [1, 0, -1]

#   coordinates = coordinates_notation.split("")
#   column = columns.index(coordinates[0])
#   row = coordinates[1].to_i
#   coordinates = [column, row]

#   possible_moves = []
#   for i in column_vars do
#     for j in row_vars do
#       possible_moves << [coordinates[0] + i, coordinates[1] + j] unless i == 0 && j == 0
#     end
#   end

#   possible_moves = possible_moves.map { |coordinates| [columns[coordinates[0]], coordinates[1]].join}

#   possible_moves = possible_moves.select { |coordinates| coordinates.length == 2 }
# end
# There might me a way to refactor the code
# up above.

########################
########## Possibility 2 for possible_moves:
# [Using notation terms as input and output.]

# def possible_moves(coordinates_notation)
#   columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
#   row_vars = [1, 0, -1]

#   coordinates = coordinates_notation.split("")
#   column_idx = columns.index(coordinates[0])

#   column_vars = [columns[column_idx - 1], coordinates[0], columns[column_idx + 1]]

#   row = coordinates[1].to_i
#   column = coordinates[0]
#   coordinates = [column, row]


#   possible_moves = []
#   for i in column_vars do
#     for j in row_vars do
#       possible_moves << [i, coordinates[1] + j] unless i == coordinates[0] && j == 0 || i == nil
#     end
#   end

#   possible_moves = possible_moves.map { |coordinates| coordinates.join}
# end

# Possiblity 3 could be here showcased
# using cell index as input, but there
# doesn't seem to be a need for that.

# Assuming user input will be on notation
# terms, #possible_moves input and output
# ought also to be on notation terms.

# As of right now, then:
# - A principle is established:
#   #possible_moves will take location
#   in notation terms and its output
#   will also be in notation terms.

# - That being defined, I have a deficient
#   possible_moves method for the king
#   chess piece.

# Why deficient?
# - It takes into no account whether
#   the position is occupied on the board
#   by another chess piece of the same
#   colour.

# How ought this to be fixed?
# - To be resolved in board #valid_move?
#   instead of in chess piece's
#   possible_moves method?

# This seems as good an idea as any.
# At a distant, a different way of seeing
# things looms, but it seems to involve
# somehow making each chess piece class
# overlap with the board class.

# This could be "as simple" as adding
# the state of the board as another parameter
# to #possible_moves. However, this doesn't
# seem, right now, to be the right thing to
# do. Problem to be resolved in #valid_move?
# of Board class!

# This being said an expansion of the various
# chess pieces' classes could now be attempted.
# The addition of the respective possible_moves
# method.


# Let us start with the Rook class.
