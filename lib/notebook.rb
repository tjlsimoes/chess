# Assignment:
# 1. Build a command line Chess game where 
#    two players can play against each other.
# 2. The game should be properly constrained 
#    – it should prevent players from making 
#      illegal moves and declare check or 
#      check mate in the correct situations.
# 3. Make it so you can save the board at 
#    any time.
# 4. Write tests for the important parts.
# 5. Do your best to keep your classes modular 
#    and clean and your methods doing only one 
#    thing each.

# ###############  High-level game overview:
# - Game between two players playing 
#   alternatively.

# - Board class initialized with the expected
#   pieces.
# - Somehow pieces will have to be black and
#   white and so must - in some manner - also
#   the chessboard squares be.

# - There ought to be a class for each type
#   of piece: rook, bishop, queen, king, ...


# - Input from users will be limited to 
#   the reference to two positions, the 
#   position of the piece to be moved and the
#   desired position of that same piece.
# - Somehow each user input will have to be
#   verified. It might not be valid.
# - Not only ought each user input be 
#   verified to be valid, but it ought also
#   be verified whether or not such a move
#   "takes" an opponent's chess piece.
# - Must not forget: taking en-passant and
#   castling.

# Must also not forget: 
# - Check and checkmate evaluations; 
# - Possibilty to quit at any time;
# - Proposition of a draw after a move made.
# - Draw claim through repetition of moves.


# Let's tackle the game board display.

# Chess symbols listed at
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode
# output symbols with very small dimensions.
# One can always play with an enlarged version of
# the command line... But even then... it's small.

# Possible black square: "\u25FB"
# Possible white sqaure: "\u25FC"
# Though, in fact, the display in irb suggests
# the contrary.

# Another possibility would be to display
# each chess piece preceded by the initial
# of its corresponding colour's name and 
# let each empty square either be empty as 
# in an empty grid or be filled with the 
# respective coordinates.

# Cells expressed in terms of axis values:

# First column == multiples of 8.
# Hence, for instance, cell[8] could be thought
# as 8 * 1 - 0 [a]

# And cell[1], could be thought as
# 8 * 1 - 7 [h]

# And cell[57], could be thought as
# 8 * 8 - 7 [h]

# cell = row * 8 - (8 - column)

# where rows span from 1-8
# and columns span from a-h, i.e. 0-7

# Hence,
# columns = {a: 0, b: 1, c: 2, d: 3,
