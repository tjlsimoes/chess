# Assignment:
# 1. Build a command line Chess game where 
#    two players can play against each other.
# 2. The game should be properly constrained 
#    â€“ it should prevent players from making 
#      illegal moves and declare check or 
#      check mate in the correct situations.
# 3. Make it so you can save the board at 
#    any time.
# 4. Write tests for the important parts.
# 5. Do your best to keep your classes modular 
#    and clean and your methods doing only one 
#    thing each.

# ###############  High-level game overview:
# - Game between two players playing 
#   alternatively.

# - Board class initialized with the expected
#   pieces.
# - Somehow pieces will have to be black and
#   white and so must - in some manner - also
#   the chessboard squares be.

# - There ought to be a class for each type
#   of piece: rook, bishop, queen, king, ...


# - Input from users will be limited to 
#   the reference to two positions, the 
#   position of the piece to be moved and the
#   desired position of that same piece.
# - Somehow each user input will have to be
#   verified. It might not be valid.
# - Not only ought each user input be 
#   verified to be valid, but it ought also
#   be verified whether or not such a move
#   "takes" an opponent's chess piece.
# - Must not forget: taking en-passant and
#   castling.

# Must also not forget: 
# - Check and checkmate evaluations; 
# - Possibilty to quit at any time;
# - Proposition of a draw after a move made.
# - Draw claim through repetition of moves.


# Let's tackle the game board display.

# Chess symbols listed at
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode
# output symbols with very small dimensions.
# One can always play with an enlarged version of
# the command line... But even then... it's small.

# Possible black square: "\u25FB"
# Possible white sqaure: "\u25FC"
# Though, in fact, the display in irb suggests
# the contrary.

# Another possibility would be to display
# each chess piece preceded by the initial
# of its corresponding colour's name and 
# let each empty square either be empty as 
# in an empty grid or be filled with the 
# respective coordinates.

############### 4 May ######################

# Let's try and use connect-four-tdd files
# to get a basic sketch of the chess game.

# How ought the various chess pieces be 
# treated?

# - In the end they ought to have an 
#   instance variable for the respective
#   symbol.
# - Ought they all to derive from one class,
# ChessPiece class?
# - Ought they to have an instance variable
# for its possible moves?

# In the end, if thinking this through
# correctly, user input will be as simple
# as the location of the piece to be moved
# with the final desired destination location.
# Something in the lines 2a-3a, for example.

# Under the hood:
# There will have to be an update_board method
# that verifies that move desired by user
# is valid and changes the board and the 
# board display accordingly.

# The verification that a desired move by a user
# is valid could perhaps be made interrogating
# the respetive piece's node whether that
# desired move is included in an instance 
# variable which would countain its
# possible moves.

# Two ways to arrange things present themselves:
# 1. Piece class to be initialized with symbol
#    and possible_moves as instance variables.
#    Bishop, rook, pawn, queen, knight classes
#    inherit from Piece class but fill 
#    possible_moves instance variables with 
#    respective methods.
# 2. Do away with Piece superclass and just 
#    create the various chess pieces' classes
#    separately.

# There really doesn't seem to be a need for 
# there to be a chess piece superclass...
# At least at the moment...

# Besides what would this inherit framework
# look like?

# class ChessPiece ; end

# class King < ChessPiece
#   attr_reader :symbol
#   def initialize(symbol)
#     @symbol = symbol
#   end

#   def possible_moves
#     ["hello"]
#   end
# end

# king = King.new("\u2654")
# p king.possible_moves
# p king.symbol

# As of right now, something that doesn't
# seem all that useful, specially if 
# it means what was above layed out.

# A class for each ChessPiece is to be then.

# Does each ChessPiece class need an 
# instance variable for its position?

# #possible_moves, currently associated with
# each ChessPiece class, will more than likely
# need the location of the respective piece
# and the current state of the board.

# So a location instance variable associated
# with each ChessPiece variable may make things
# easier for the possible_moves method.

# Class for each ChessPiece will then have
# as instance variables: location and symbol.
# Possible moves can perhaps remain a method.

# Location ought to have a setter method, as it
# ought to be able to change.
# Symbol can perhaps only have a getter method.

# Example: 

# class King
#   attr_accessor :location
#   attr_reader :symbol
#   def initialize(symbol, location)
#     @symbol = symbol
#     @location = location
#   end

#   def possible_moves

#   end
# end

# king = King.new("\u2654", "e1")

# p king.symbol
# p king.location
