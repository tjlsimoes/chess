# Assignment:
# 1. Build a command line Chess game where
#    two players can play against each other.
# 2. The game should be properly constrained
#    â€“ it should prevent players from making
#      illegal moves and declare check or
#      check mate in the correct situations.
# 3. Make it so you can save the board at
#    any time.
# 4. Write tests for the important parts.
# 5. Do your best to keep your classes modular
#    and clean and your methods doing only one
#    thing each.

# ###############  High-level game overview:
# - Game between two players playing
#   alternatively.

# - Board class initialized with the expected
#   pieces.
# - Somehow pieces will have to be black and
#   white and so must - in some manner - also
#   the chessboard squares be.

# - There ought to be a class for each type
#   of piece: rook, bishop, queen, king, ...


# - Input from users will be limited to
#   the reference to two positions, the
#   position of the piece to be moved and the
#   desired position of that same piece.
# - Somehow each user input will have to be
#   verified. It might not be valid.
# - Not only ought each user input be
#   verified to be valid, but it ought also
#   be verified whether or not such a move
#   "takes" an opponent's chess piece.
# - Must not forget: taking en-passant and
#   castling.

# Must also not forget:
# - Check and checkmate evaluations;
# - Possibilty to quit at any time;
# - Proposition of a draw after a move made.
# - Draw claim through repetition of moves.
# - Exchange of pieces when other end of
#   board is reached.


# Let's tackle the game board display.

# Chess symbols listed at
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode
# output symbols with very small dimensions.
# One can always play with an enlarged version of
# the command line... But even then... it's small.

# Possible black square: "\u25FB"
# Possible white sqaure: "\u25FC"
# Though, in fact, the display in irb suggests
# the contrary.

# Another possibility would be to display
# each chess piece preceded by the initial
# of its corresponding colour's name and
# let each empty square either be empty as
# in an empty grid or be filled with the
# respective coordinates.

############### 4 May ######################

# Let's try and use connect-four-tdd files
# to get a basic sketch of the chess game.

# How ought the various chess pieces be
# treated?

# - In the end they ought to have an
#   instance variable for the respective
#   symbol.
# - Ought they all to derive from one class,
# ChessPiece class?
# - Ought they to have an instance variable
# for its possible moves?

# In the end, if thinking this through
# correctly, user input will be as simple
# as the location of the piece to be moved
# with the final desired destination location.
# Something in the lines of 2a-3a, for example.

# Under the hood:
# There will have to be an update_board method
# that verifies that move desired by user
# is valid and changes the board and the
# board display accordingly.

# The verification that a desired move by a user
# is valid could perhaps be made interrogating
# the respetive piece's node whether that
# desired move is included in an instance
# variable which would countain its
# possible moves.

# Two ways to arrange things present themselves:
# 1. Piece class to be initialized with symbol
#    and possible_moves as instance variables.
#    Bishop, rook, pawn, queen, knight classes
#    inherit from Piece class but fill
#    possible_moves instance variables with
#    respective methods.
# 2. Do away with Piece superclass and just 
#    create the various chess pieces' classes
#    separately.

# There really doesn't seem to be a need for
# there to be a chess piece superclass...
# At least at the moment...

# Besides what would this inherit framework
# look like?

# class ChessPiece ; end

# class King < ChessPiece
#   attr_reader :symbol
#   def initialize(symbol)
#     @symbol = symbol
#   end

#   def possible_moves
#     ["hello"]
#   end
# end

# king = King.new("\u2654")
# p king.possible_moves
# p king.symbol

# As of right now, something that doesn't
# seem all that useful, specially if
# it means what was above layed out.

# A class for each ChessPiece is to be then.

# Does each ChessPiece class need an
# instance variable for its position?

# #possible_moves, currently associated with
# each ChessPiece class, will more than likely
# need the location of the respective piece
# and the current state of the board.

# So a location instance variable associated
# with each ChessPiece variable may make things
# easier for the possible_moves method.

# Class for each ChessPiece will then have
# as instance variables: location and symbol.
# Possible moves can perhaps remain a method.

# Location ought to have a setter method, as it
# ought to be able to change.
# Symbol can perhaps only have a getter method.

# Example:

# class King
#   attr_accessor :location
#   attr_reader :symbol
#   def initialize(symbol, location)
#     @symbol = symbol
#     @location = location
#   end

#   def possible_moves

#   end
# end

# king = King.new("\u2654", "e1")

# p king.symbol
# p king.location

# Now a decision has to be made on what
# type of values ought to be passed to
# each class' location instance variable.

# Whether the board cell index or the
# "letter + number" notation.

# Be it as it may, a conversion is possible
# between the two:

# cell = row * 8 - (8 - column)
# cell = number * 8 -(8 - letter)

# columns = {a: 0, b: 1, c: 2, d: 3,
#              e: 4, f: 5, g: 6, h: 7}

# e.g. e1 == 1 * 8 - (8 - 4) == 4, cell[4]


# As regards the intialization of each
# chess piece class instance the concrete
# manner of filling out the location
# instance variable doesn't seem to favour
# any one side more than the other...

# Where it might be relevant is in regard to:
# 1. Changing the location instance variable
#    due to user input.
#    If notation is used to set location
#    instance variable its update wouldn't
#    have to rely on a translation of the user
#    user input.
# 2. Calculation of the possible moves.
#    On connect-four-tdd project the relation
#    between certain squares of the board and
#    others was explored using board indexes.
#    Would the exploration of the chess board
#    - required, at least to some extent, for
#    each piece on the board - have to rely
#    on a permanent translation of every chess
#    board position/index to a notation value?
#    If so and in a glance, this seems to imply
#    much more translation than the mere
#    translation of user input.

# Let's assume the mistake: location instance
# variable to be defined in the notation terms
# previously exemplified: [a-h][1-8].
# Possible moves method ought to translate
# notation value into cell index and explore
# its relation to other chess board squares
# in that manner: comparing board indexes.

# In connect-four-tdd a problem arose: that of
# "wrapping children"; that is, the relation
# between indexes of end-of-row and beggining-
# -of-new-row.
# Would that be avoided in using notation
# instead of cell indexes?
# From a far-sighted perspective, it seems not.

# How would the relation between chess board
# squares be explored in notation terms?
# In the same manner, it seems, as when
# board indexes are used. Only the possible
# changes, the possible moves would be expressed
# as variations in rows [1-8] and in columns [a-h].

# Only variations in columns would not be obtained,
# at least directly, through an arithmetic operation
# such as the addition or subraction of x units.
# To be sure that could be made if an array of [a-h]
# was created where "a" would stand for 0 and "h" for 7.

# Let us take a concrete example and examine the
# different possibilities.

# Let us take a king at cell[33]. King's possible
# moves would be:

# 34,             # 41, 42,               # 25, 26

# However, generally, a king would admit the moves
# derived from the addition of the following numbers:

# vars = [-1, 1, 8, -8, 9, -9, 7, -7]

# As was identified not all those variations should
# actually be counted as possible for a king at
# cells[33].
# As was done in connect-four-tdd this problem could
# be solved by introducing a guard clause.

# However the question that is now being explored
# is whether or not this problem would not arise
# if the notation previously defined ([a-h][1-8])
# was used to define the changes that could result
# in the possible moves for a given chess piece.

# Let us again consider a king at cells[33], that is
# at h5. King's possible moves would be:

# g5,             # g6, h6,               # g4, h4

# The question then now is how could one obtain
# the king's possible moves in notation terms?

# Formally:
# row_vars = [1, 0, -1]
# column_vars = [1, 0, -1]

# Kings possible moves would be expressed through a
# nested loop covering each element of the two arrays
# identified.

# Notation columns could be translated into numbers
# for that purpose.
# Directly, using a hash as the one downbelow:
# columns = {a: 0, b: 1, c: 2, d: 3,
#              e: 4, f: 5, g: 6, h: 7}

# Or perhaps more usefully, in reference to an ordered
# data structure such as an array. Where the letter's
# index would correspond to its actual value. As
# shown below:
# columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
# columns[0] = a
# columns[1] = b

# Given this framework how could one translate a notation
# value into something that could be used to attain its
# possible moves?

# Using the coordinates h5.
# columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
# row_vars = [1, 0, -1]
# column_vars = [1, 0, -1]
# coordinates_notation = "h5"

# coordinates = coordinates_notation.split("")      #== ["h", "5"]
# column = columns.index(coordinates[0])            #== 7
# row = coordinates[1].to_i                         #== 5
# coordinates = [column, row]

# possible_moves = []
# for i in column_vars do
#   for j in row_vars do
#     possible_moves << [coordinates[0] + i, coordinates[1] + j] unless i == 0 && j == 0
#   end
# end

# possible_moves    #== [[8, 6], [8, 5], [8, 4], [7, 6], [7, 5], [7, 4], [6, 6], [6, 5], [6, 4]]

# possible_moves = possible_moves.map { |coordinates| [columns[coordinates[0]], coordinates[1]].join}

#         #== ["6", "5", "4", "h6", "h5", "h4", "g6", "g5", "g4"]

# possible_moves = possible_moves.select { |coordinates| coordinates.length == 2 }

#         #== ["h6", "h4", "g6", "g5", "g4"]


# And how would one obtain king's possible
# moves using its cell index? 

# As said above, generally, a king would admit the moves
# derived from the addition of the following numbers:

# vars = [-1, 1, 8, -8, 9, -9, 7, -7]

# However, safeguard conditions have to be put in place
# of when king would be at the first column or at the 
# last column.

# last_column_idxs = [1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57]
# first_column_idxs = [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64]

# Will not work with king on last column (h):
# -1, -9, 7

# Will not work with king on first column (a):
# 1, 9, -7

# vars_last_column = [ 1, 8, -8, 9, -7]
# vars_first_column = [-1, 8, -8, -9, 7]

# Let us take a king at cells[33]

# coordinates = 33

# def possible_moves(idx)
#   possible_moves = []

#   last_column_idxs = [1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57]
#   first_column_idxs = [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64]

#   vars = [-1, 1, 8, -8, 9, -9, 7, -7]
#   vars_last_column = [ 1, 8, -8, 9, -7]
#   vars_first_column = [-1, 8, -8, -9, 7]

#   if last_column_idxs.include?(idx)
#     vars_last_column.each do |value|
#       possible_moves << idx + value
#     end
#   elsif first_column_idxs.include?(idx)
#     vars_first_column.each do |value|
#       possible_moves << idx + value
#     end
#   else
#     vars.each do |value|
#       possible_moves << idx + value
#     end
#   end
#   possible_moves
# end

# possible_moves(33)  #==[34, 41, 25, 42, 26]

# Must not forget however that user input
# will be in notation. A conversion of the
# notation value into index will, thus, be
# needed.

######### Conversion from notation to index:
# cell == number * 8 -(8 - letter) ### Wrong!!!
# cell == number * 8 - letter

######### Conversion from index to notation:
# columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
# if cell % 8 != 0
#   number = (cell / 8) + 1
#   columns[8 - (cell % 8)]
# else
#   number = cell / 8   ### Corrected!!!
#   letter = "a"


############### 6 May ######################

# Problem being tackled was:
# - Articulation between user input and
#   possible_moves method inherent to each
#   chess piece class.

# The fundamental question was on which terms
# ought the location instance variable inherent
# to each chess piece class be defined: either
# in notation terms or in indexes terms.

# And a train of thought was constructed
# focusing on the articulation between the
# location instance variable and the method
# possible_moves.

# Two different possible implementations
# of possible_moves were sketched out.

########################
########## Possibility 1 for possible_moves:
# [Using notation terms as input and output.]

# def possible_moves(coordinates_notation)
#   columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
#   row_vars = [1, 0, -1]
#   column_vars = [1, 0, -1]

#   coordinates = coordinates_notation.split("")
#   column = columns.index(coordinates[0])
#   row = coordinates[1].to_i
#   coordinates = [column, row]

#   possible_moves = []
#   for i in column_vars do
#     for j in row_vars do
#       possible_moves << [coordinates[0] + i, coordinates[1] + j] unless i == 0 && j == 0
#     end
#   end

#   possible_moves = possible_moves.map { |coordinates| [columns[coordinates[0]], coordinates[1]].join}

#   possible_moves = possible_moves.select { |coordinates| coordinates.length == 2 }
# end
# There might me a way to refactor the code
# up above.

########################
########## Possibility 2 for possible_moves:
# [Using notation terms as input and output.]

# def possible_moves(coordinates_notation)
#   columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
#   row_vars = [1, 0, -1]

#   coordinates = coordinates_notation.split("")
#   column_idx = columns.index(coordinates[0])

#   column_vars = [columns[column_idx - 1], coordinates[0], columns[column_idx + 1]]

#   row = coordinates[1].to_i
#   column = coordinates[0]
#   coordinates = [column, row]


#   possible_moves = []
#   for i in column_vars do
#     for j in row_vars do
#       possible_moves << [i, coordinates[1] + j] unless i == coordinates[0] && j == 0 || i == nil
#     end
#   end

#   possible_moves = possible_moves.map { |coordinates| coordinates.join}
# end

# Possiblity 3 could be here showcased
# using cell index as input, but there
# doesn't seem to be a need for that.

# Assuming user input will be on notation
# terms, #possible_moves input and output
# ought also to be on notation terms.

# As of right now, then:
# - A principle is established:
#   #possible_moves will take location
#   in notation terms and its output
#   will also be in notation terms.

# - That being defined, I have a deficient
#   possible_moves method for the king
#   chess piece.

# Why deficient?
# - It takes into no account whether
#   the position is occupied on the board
#   by another chess piece of the same
#   colour.
# - It is not currently associated with
#   location instance variable!

# How ought this to be fixed?
# - To be resolved in board #valid_move?
#   instead of in chess piece's
#   possible_moves method?

# This seems as good an idea as any.
# At a distant, a different way of seeing
# things looms, but it seems to involve
# somehow making each chess piece class
# overlap with the board class.

# This could be "as simple" as adding
# the state of the board as another parameter
# to #possible_moves. However, this doesn't
# seem, right now, to be the right thing to
# do. Problem to be resolved in #valid_move?
# of Board class!

# Also solved:
# âœ“ It is not currently associated with
#   location instance variable!

# This being said an expansion of the various
# chess pieces' classes could now be attempted.
# The addition of the respective possible_moves
# method.


# Let us start with the Rook class [Tower class].

# Formally, a rook's possible moves will
# correspond to all possible variations on the
# x-axis with the y-axis unaltered, on the one
# hand and, on the other hand, all possible
# variations on the y-axis with the x-axis
# unaltered.

# Let us take "d5" as the rook's location.

# location = "d5"

# columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]

# possible_moves = []

# coordinates = location.split("")

# columns.delete(coordinates[0])
# column_vars = columns


# rows = Array(1..8)
# (Array(1..8)).delete(coordinates[1])
# row_vars = rows

# for i in column_vars do
#   possible_moves << [i, coordinates[1]].join
# end

# for i in row_vars do
#   possible_moves << [coordinates[0], i].join
# end

# possible_moves

############### 8 May ######################

# Problem being tackled:

#       âœ“ King, Rook

# Formally:
# Bishop's possible moves will correspond
# to all possible changes within a board
# with linear proportinal and simultaneous
#  changes in the x-axis and the y axis.

# Let us take "d5" as the bishop's location.

# #possible_moves will have to output:

# - Not to mention that #possible_moves

# Problem being tackled:
# - #possible_moves for each chess piece
#   respective class.
#       âœ“ King, Rook, Bishop, Queen, Knight
#       - Pawn

# Let's tackle Pawn's #possible_moves

# Pawn is a weird piece.
# Not only does it move differently
# when it has never moved, it also moves
# differently when takin an opponent's
# chess piece.

# For the time being the best course of
# action seems to be to include possible
# diagonal moves into #possible_moves.
# And also, in a conditional flow, the
# possible two square initial move.

# Perhaps later implement an additional
# layer of validation of user input
# in Board#valid_move? ?

# Also ignoring en passant move for now.

# Add a @unmoved instance variable to each
# pawn piece. Set by default to true. With
# a setter method enabled.

# #possible_moves ought to output different
# results in light of @unmoved's value.

# Irregardless of that, pawn's possible moves
# equal, formally, to two most close forward
# diagonal squares and closemost forward square.

# Assuming a pawn at "d5".
# possible_moves ought to equal:
# ["d6", "e6", "c6"]

# location = "d5"

# columns = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
# possible_moves = []

# coordinates = location.split("")
# column_idx = columns.index(coordinates[0])
# row = coordinates[1].to_i

# column_vars = [columns[column_idx - 1], coordinates[0], columns[column_idx + 1]]

# for i in column_vars do

#   possible_moves << [i, row + 1 ].join if row + 1 <= 8
# end

# p possible_moves

# Additional logic has to be added for
# it to have a conditional flow in respect
# to the @unmoved instance variable.

# unmoved = true

# ###### High-level game overview renovated:
# - Game between two players playing
#   alternatively.

# - Input from users will be limited to
#   the reference to two positions, the
#   position of the piece to be moved and the
#   desired position of that same piece.
# - Somehow each user input will have to be
#   verified. It might not be valid.
# - Not only ought each user input be
#   verified to be valid, but it ought also
#   be verified whether or not such a move
#   "takes" an opponent's chess piece.
# - Must not forget: taking en-passant and
#   castling.

# Must also not forget:
# - Check and checkmate evaluations;
# - Possibilty to quit at any time;
# - Proposition of a draw after a move made.
# - Draw claim through repetition of moves.
# - Exchange of pieces when other end of
#   board is reached.

# What ought to be my next working point?
# Ideally the next most immediate goal
# ought to be to have an actually working
# chess game on the terminal.

# The next most immmediate logic step in
# that direction seems to be to work
# on Board#valid_move? and Board#update_board
# methods.

# Board#valid_moved? would be called from
# within Board#update_board.

# Conceptually I was thinking on one single
# user input which would need to include two
# things given simultaneously: location of
# the desired piece to be moved and the end
# location of that same piece.

# However that user input could be broken into
# two moments: (1) which chess piece ought to
# and (2)to where it ought to move.

# Be that as it may, Board#update_board will
# take in the previously stated two elements,
# come as they may (simultaneously or not).

# Board#update_board ought to call from
# Board#valid_move? and then update the board
# and the board display accordingly.

# Conceptually Board#valid_move? was being
# thought as something as simple as checking
# whether or not the designated chess piece
# at the specified location included the
# desired location in its respective
# possible_moves method output.

# Things don't seem, however, to be that
# simple.
# Why?
# Possibly due to a misconception as regards
# to what #possible_moves ought to be.

# #possible_moves currently lists all possible
# moves of a given chess piece in an empty board!

# More than that, as is the case with Pawn,
# it lists "possibly not possible" moves -
# the diagonal moves are only valid if there is
# an opponent piece at that square.

# Not to mention it currently also doesn't
# take in account of en passant, castling
# and possible exchange between pieces.

# But one thing at a time.

# One thing than can - and perhaps ought to -
# be done before all this is to make Board.new
# generate a duly populated board!

############### 10 May #####################

# Problem to be tackled:
# - Duly populate Board with initial board.

# Problem solved:
# âœ“ Duly populate Board with initial board.

# The next most immmediate logic step in
# that direction seems to be to work
# on Board#valid_move? and Board#update_board
# methods.

# Conceptually Board#valid_move? was being
# thought as something as simple as checking
# whether or not the designated chess piece
# at the specified location included the
# desired location in its respective
# possible_moves method output.

# However as #possible_moves is currently
# implemented that logic is not enough.

# #possible_moves does not take in account:
# - Impeded lines to certain squares by other
# chess pieces.
# - As regards to Pawn it contains "possibly
#   not possible" positions: diagonal takes.
# - It also doesn't take into account:
#   en passant, castling, chess piece's
#   exchange.
# - Restrictions on moves due to mate and
#   checkmate.

# Question seems to be:
# How ought these problems to be adrressed?
# - Do they call for a refactor of
#   #possible_moves?
# - Or ought #possible_moves to stay as is
#   and adress these problems at the level
#   of the Board#valid_move? ?

# Perhaps a combination of both answers is
# the way to go.

# If these problems were to be addressed at
# the level of Board#valid_move?, what
# concrete solutions would have to be
# put forward?

# What mechanism could be implemented so as
# to prevent assumption of certain squares
# as possible moves, regardless of the path
# towards them being blocked?

# A certain dependency between possible moves
# would have to be implemented.
# Such that when some or one is not possible
# it would have a cascading effect on the
# possible moves: they would seize to be
# taken as possible moves.

# With the current possible_moves method,
# Board#valid_move? can not be as simple as
# checking if desired end position for a
# given chess piece is included in its
# possible_moves method output.
# It has also to check:
# (a) If end-position is free or occupied
#     by an opponent's chess piece.
# (b) If path to desired location is blocked.
# (c) Pawn's disparate possible movements.
# (d) Mate and checkmate conditions.
# (e) Castling, en passant, exchange.

# If (a) was the only problem, the solution
# would be simple:
# To the verification that the end-position
# would be on #possible_moves output, extra
# conditions would have to be placed: for it
# to be either free or occupied by an
# opponent's chess piece. The latter case
# would then have to result in a peculiar
# form of Board#update_board. Not only would
# it have to remove and relocate one piece,
# but also remove another entirely from the
# board.

# Problem (b) calls for the evalution of the
# board status in certain possible lines of
# movement.

# In light of problem (b) it seems that a
# certain definition of the relation between
# the designated piece location and its
# desired end-location has to be defined.

# If it requires an horizontal movement, to
# the left or to the right.
# If it requires a vertical movement, upwards
# or downwards.
# If it requires a diagonal movement, in any
# of the 4 possible directions:
# - right upwards;        # - left upwards;
# - right downwards;      # - left downwads;

# In light of this valid_move? ought to still
# check if desired end-positon would be
# included in the piece's #possible_moves.
# But it would have to additionally define
# the relation between location and
# end-location so as to avoid making
# impossible moves (path being blocked).

# Moreover it seems that problem (b) only
# concerns certain pieces: rook, bishop,
# queen.

# How could one extract the type of movement
# involved in a certain play from the user
# input of piece-location and desired
# piece end-location?

# Horizontal movement:
# Same row, different collumn.
# If end-column > initial-column: (i)
#     horizontal to the right;
# If end-column < initial-column: (ii)
#     horizontal to the right;

# Vertical movement:
# Same column, different row.     (I)
# If end-row > initial-row:
#     vertical upwards
# If end-row < initial-row:       (II)
#     vertical downwards

# Diagonal movement:
# (i), (I): right upwards;
# (i), (II): right downwards;
# (ii), (I): left upwards;
# (ii), (II): left downwards;

# Based on this information it could
# be verified whether all positions
# between chess piece location and its
# desired end-location are free.

# For horizontal and vertical movement
# the code for that seems somewhat
# straightforward.

# Horizontal movement:
# Maintain row, change column by factor
# of 1, incresing or decreasing in light
# of specific horizontal movement.
# Of course, an equiparation between
# numbers and columns would have to be made
# here.

# Vertical movement:
# Maintain column, change row by factor of 1,
# increasing or decreasing in light of
# specific vertical movement.

# Diagonal movement seems a bit more complex.

# Diagonal movement:
# Both column and row would have to vary.
# And perhaps vary differently in light of
# specific diagonal movement.
# Diagonal movement would correspond to the
# combined variation of the row and column
# by a factor of 1, in light of the specific
# diagonal movement.

# Different moments of functionality:
# - Assess type of movement;
# - Check if there are pieces between
#   initial-location and end-location.

#   square.
# - Moved two squares forward to an unoccupied
#   square if intermediate square is not
#   occupied and pawn to be moved has not yet
#   been moved.
# - Moved to the right or left diagonal

# Points that need work:
# - Errors due to invalid user input result
#   in game crashing.
# - Mate and chekmate evaluation.
# - En passant, castling, exchange of pieces.

# What is check?
# When the king of a player can be taken by
#  a piece of the opponent, one says that
# the king is in check.

# It is not allowed to make a move,
#  such that ones king is in check after
# the move.

# There are three different possible ways
# to remove a check:
# 1. Move the king away to a square where
#    he is not in check.
# 2. Take the piece that gives the check.
# 3. In case of a check, given by a rook,
#     bishop or queen: move a piece between
#     the checking piece and the king.

# What is checkmate?
# When a player is in check, and he cannot
# make a move such that after the move,
# the king is not in check, then he is mated.

# The player that is mated lost the game,
# and the player that mated him won the game.

# Essentially:
# Check seems to call for an evaluation
# of the king's status. If it is in danger
# of being taken by any of the opponent's
# pieces.
# Checkmate seems to call not only for a
# check evaluation, but also for a check
# evaluation to all the possible king
# movements.

# How could a check evaluation be most
# efficiently done?

# It could be achieved by:
# - Checking if any of the kings' opponent
#   pieces include its location in their
#   respective possible moves method. Plus
#   an evaluation of it being an actual
#   valid move.

# This seems to require, for each king:
# - Evaluation of the king's colour and

# - Checking if they include the king's
#   location.
# - Checking if the piece with that

#   valid move.
#    - This last point seems to require more

#      between the piece and its

#      Perhaps an hash or an array with
#      nested arrays would do the trick.
#      Or perhaps a more complex evaluation
#      of the opponent's chess pieces on the
#      board would suffice. For instances,
#      a search for an opponent's chess piece
#      (disparate colour) that contains the
#      king's location in its #possible_moves.

# âœ“ Sketch of Board#checkmate? and, hence,
#   of Board#game_over?

# Points that need work:
# - Errors due to invalid user input result
#   in game crashing.
# - En passant, castling, exchange of pieces.
# - Win statements logic does not apply.

# Castling:
# The following conditions must be met:
# (a) The king that makes the castling move
#     has not yet moved in the game.
# (b) The rook that makes the castling move
#     has not yet moved in the game.
# (c) The king is not in check.
# (d) The king does not move over a square
#     that is attacked by an enemy piece
#     during the castling move.
# (e) The king does not move to a square that
#   is attacked by an enemy piece during the
#   castling move.
# (f) All squares between the rook and king
#   before the castling move are empty.
# (g) The King and rook must occupy the same
#   rank (or row).


# (a) and (b) call for an unmoved instance
# variable on King and Rook, similar to the
# one defined on the Pawn class.
# As things now stand, this might call for
# a new branch on the conditional flow of
# Board#update_board: update King and Rook
# respective unmoved instance variables.

# (c) can be easily taken care: simply call
# check?(king_loc).

# (d) can perhaps be solved by calling
# check? for each square that the king is
# meant to transverse.

# (e): simply call check? on king's end
# location.

# (f): check if pieces' locations' rows
# match.

# How ought the possibility of castling
# be integrated to the code already written?

# - It requires a new definition of
#   Board#update_board: it escapes the logic
#   of changing the start-square to nil and
#   replacing the end-square witht the
#   previously definition of the start-square.
# - It requires an update, seemingly within
#   Board#update_board on @unmoved for both
#   Rook and King piece.

# - It constitutes a new possibility that
#   has to be accounted for in
#   Board#valid_move?. This also calls for
#   a lookout on the possible repercussions
#   of the redefinition of Board#valid_move?
#   to include this possibility. Namely, will
#   it have any undesired effect on the
#   check or checkmate evaluation?

# How ought then the castling possibility
# be concretely integrated into
# Board#valid_move?
# 1. Identification that it is a castling
#    type of movement.
# 2. Evaluation of the various conditions
#    that need to be met for castling move
#    to be valid.

# How is a castling movement to be
# identified?
# As of right now, Board#valid_move? takes
# in user_input, that is, an array such as
# ["a6", "b7"].
# It then defines variables for the start-
# and end-locations and variables for the
# respective indexes.
# Given this input, how ought a castling
# movement to be identified?

# What ought the user_input for a castling
# move be?
# - The actual end locations for the king
#   and rook.
#                  or
# - The starting positions of both the king
#   and the rook.

# Second possibility for user_input seems
# more adequate.

# Ought there to be a restriction as to the
# referencing index on user_input for a
# castling move: e.g. the location for the
# king ought to come first and the location
# for the rook ought to come second in
# user_input?
# For now, let's try not to impose any
# restriction of this order. It seems a bit
# too artificial.

##### User input for castling move:
# Ought to be locations of to be moved
# king and rook.

# To that light, castling move ought to be
# able to be identified by:
# - Checking that both locations point to
#   a rook and a king of the same colour.
# - A rook and a king of the same colour
#   on the same row.

# How to check that both locations point to
# a rook and a king of the same colour?

# Let's consider an example:

# user_input = ["e8", "a8"]

# start_loc = user_input[0]
# end_loc = user_input[1]

# idx_start_loc = notation_to_cell(user_input[0])
# idx_end_loc = notation_to_cell(user_input[1])

# def castling?(idx_start, idx_end, start_loc, end_loc)
#   king_and_rook?(idx_start, idx_end) &&
#     !opponent?(idx_start, idx_end) &&
#       same_row?(start_loc, end_loc)
# end

# def same_row?(start_loc, end_loc)
#   start_loc[1] == end_loc[1]
# end

# def king_and_rook?(idx_start, idx_end)
#   cells[idx_start].is_a?(King) && cells[idx_end].is_a?(Rook) ||
#       cells[idx_end].is_a?(King) && cells[idx_start].is_a?(Rook)
# end

# Point being worked on:
# - Integrating castling possibily into
#   current code.

# Artificial or not, a restriction on the
# user input for a castling move would make
# its evaluation easier.
# Let it be so that:

########### Castling move, input restriction:
# User input ought to include the king and
# rook locations that are to be moved.
# King's location ought to come first. And
# the rook's location ought to come second.

# Hence, as of right now, identification of
# a castling move seems to be taken care of.
# Its evaluation then ought to be the next
# effort.

# Remember, for castling the following
# conditions must be met:
# (a) The king that makes the castling move
#     has not yet moved in the game.
# (b) The rook that makes the castling move
#     has not yet moved in the game.
# (c) The king is not in check.
# (d) The king does not move over a square
#     that is attacked by an enemy piece
#     during the castling move.
# (e) The king does not move to a square that
#   is attacked by an enemy piece during the
#   castling move.
# (f) All squares between the rook and king
#   before the castling move are empty.
# (g) The King and rook must occupy the same
#   rank (or row).


# (a) and (b) call for an unmoved instance
# variable on King and Rook, similar to the
# one defined on the Pawn class.
# As things now stand, this might call for
# a new branch on the conditional flow of
# Board#update_board: update King and Rook
# respective unmoved instance variables.

# (c) can be easily taken care: simply call
# check?(king_loc).

# (d) can perhaps be solved by calling
# check? for each square that the king is
# meant to transverse.

# (e): simply call check? on king's end
# location.

# (f) call Board#intermediate_squares and
# check that all squares are emtpy.

# (g): check if pieces' locations' rows
# match.


# (a) and (b):
# def unmoved?(idx)
#   celss[idx].unmoved == true
# end

# (c): call check? on king idx.
# (d): call check? on intermediate_steps
# (e): call check? on to be end king idx.
# (f): call intermediate_squares


# Conditions (d) and (e) require an
# understanding of where the king ought to
# end up.

# When castling, the king moves two squares
# towards the rook, and the rook moves over
# the king to the next square.

# The matter is the rook can be on the left
# or on the right of the king.
# This seems to call for a conditional flow
# in regard to the specific column relation
# between king and rook on a castling move.

# Assuming an user input with the treatment
# below:

# user_input = ["e8", "a8"]

# start_loc = user_input[0]
# end_loc = user_input[1]

# idx_start_loc = notation_to_cell(user_input[0])
# idx_end_loc = notation_to_cell(user_input[1])

# def castling_end_locations(start_loc)
#   columns = %w[a b c d e f g h]
#   start_loc_col_idx = columns.index(start_loc[0])

#   if start_loc[0] > end_loc[0]
#     king_end_loc = [columns.index(start_loc_col_idx - 2), start_loc[1]].join
#     rook_end_loc = [columns.index(start_loc_col_idx - 1), start_loc[1]].join
#   else
#     king_end_loc = [columns.index(start_loc_col_idx + 2), start_loc[1]].join
#     rook_end_loc = [columns.index(start_loc_col_idx + 1), start_loc[1]].join
#   end

#   [king_end_loc, rook_end_loc]
# end


# check?(king_end_loc)

# intermediate_squares([king_end_loc, start_loc]).all? do |square|
#   !check?(square)
# end


# As of right now, seemingly, any castling
# movement ought to be considered a valid
# move.

# The refactor of Board#update_board for it
# to include the specificity of castling
# movements is, however, still missing.

# Repercussions of integration of castling
# movement on Board#update_board:
# - Need to introduce a conditional flow
#   into board redefinition in case of
#   user_input being a castling movement?
# - Need to update @unmoved for king and
#   rook in case of a castling movement.

# Seemingly:
# âœ“ Integration of castling possibility
#   into game in general and, concretely,
#   to Board#valid_move? and
#   Board#update_board.


# Points that need work:
# - Errors due to invalid user input result
#   in game crashing.
# - Message on restrictions of user input
#   for it to signal a castling movement.
# - En passant, exchange of pieces.
# - Win statements logic does not apply.

# - En passant, exchange of pieces.
# - Win statements logic does not apply.
# - Include check? clause into valid_move?

# Point to be worked on:
# - Taking en-passant integration.

# There is one special rule, called taking
# en-passant. When a pawn makes a double
# step from the second row to the fourth row,
# and there is an enemy pawn on an adjacent
# square on the fourth row, then this enemy
# pawn in the next move may move diagonally
# to the square that was passed over by the
# double-stepping pawn, which is on the third
# row.
# In this same move, the double-stepping pawn
# is taken. This taking en-passant must be
# done directly: if the player who could take
# en-passant does not do this in the first move
# after the double step, this pawn cannot be
# taken anymore by an en-passant move.


# How ought the taking en-passant be thought?
# When is taking en-passant really a possible
# move?
# You can capture en passant when your pawn
# is one square deep into your opponent's
# half of the board, and they move their pawn
# two squares from its starting square such
# that it lands directly next to yours.

# Taking en-passant becomes possible whenever
# a previously unmoved pawn is moved two
# squares forward such that it lands to the
# side of an opponent pawn.

# Taking en-passant calls for a refactoring
# of Board#update_board as is: taking
# en-passant doesn't just require
# changing the starting position to nil and
# updating the end-square. It calls for
# the update to nil of the pawn that is to
# be "indirectly taken".
# More than that: perhaps a new conditional
# dimension ought to be added to
# Board#update_board for there to be a log
# of possible taking en-passant moves.

# Let's try focus on this new conditional
# dimension of Board#update_board seemingly
# required.

# As of right now Board#update_board already
# updates Pawn@unmoved whenever a pawn is
# moved.
# Perhaps a new conditional can be added
# that would check for a possible taking
# en-passant movement on the next play.

# Logic seems to have to be:
# if pawn moved two squares
#   - check if there's an opponent pawn
#   to either side of pawn's end location
#   - depending on the side, list possible
#   taking en-passant movement as an array
#   that ought to be equal to the user input
#   that would indicate that movement, e.g.
#   pawn moved to "d4" with opponent pawn
#   at "c4", possible taking en-passant
#   ought to be defined: ["c4", "d3"].

# Correction and addition of tests for code
# sketched out previously for taking
# en-passant.

# Still missing:
# Complete and actual integration of
# #possible_en_passant into currently
# sketched out chess game code.

# #possible_en_passant was being thought as
# something to be included into
# Board#update_board.

# On receiving user_input Board#update_board
# would check if user_input would amount to
# an unmoved pawn moved two squares by the
# method Board#unmoved_pawn_twosq?.

# If it checked out true, the idea would
# be:
# - To do things as usual: update the
#   board as would befit a move of an
#   unmoved pawn by two squares.
#   - With the current code that would
#     amount to following the normal
#     conditional flow (updating start to
#     nil and end to pawn). With the
#     addition, however, of the @unmoved
#     update to false.
# - And also perhaps update a board instance
#   variable (e.g. @possible_en_passant)
#   that would be integrated into the
#   Board#valid_move? conditional flow and
#   reset at the end of every "other player
#   move."

# Hence, integration of #possible_en_passant
# seems to call for a 3 step process:
# - Update of Board#update_board.
# - Update of Board#valid_move?.
# - Update of game dynamic to reset a
#   possible board instance variable named
#   @possible_en_passant.


# Points that need work:
# - Errors due to invalid user input result
#   in game crashing.
# - Message on restrictions of user input
#   for it to signal a castling movement.
# - En passant, exchange of pieces.
# - Win statements logic does not apply.
# - Include check? clause into valid_move?
# - Error on checkmate evaluation:
#   d2-d4, c7-c5, e1-d2, d5-a5 does not
#   result in checkmate.

# Point to be worked on:
# - Integration of #possible_en_passant.

# It was said:
# Integration of #possible_en_passant
# seems to call for a 3 step process:
# - Update of Board#update_board.
# - Update of Board#valid_move?.
# - Update of game dynamic to reset a
#   possible board instance variable named
#   @possible_en_passant.

# How ought an instance variable
# @possible_en_passant be integrated into
# game dynamic?

# 1. It ought to start empty or as a nil
#    value.
# 2. Depending on user input, it may be
#    updated to include a possible opponent's
#    movement.
# 3. Opponent ought to input its user input.
# 4. All conditionals concerning user input
#    and #possible_en_passant ought to be
#    verified. Centrally: on Board#valid_move?.
#     a - If it turns out that opponent is
#         inputing a taking en-passant move
#         #possible_en_passant output ought
#         to validate user input.
#       - Board#update_board ought also
#         to perform according to that
#         specific context.
#       - @possible_en_passant ought to be
#         reset.
#     b - If it turns out that opponent is
#         inputting a move that opens a
#         possible taking en_passant from
#         its opponent.
#       - @possible_en_passant ought to be
#         reset.
#       - @possible_en_passant ought to be
#         updated

# It seems that:
# - Default @possible_en_passant has to be []
#   for #include? to be a valid method.
# - @possible_en_passant has to be reset:
#     - after valid_move? of opponent user
#       input;
#     - before its update based on opponent
#       user input.

# So the question seems to be:
# Where ought Board@possible_en_passant be
# updated?

# Perhaps as was being thought previously:
# Within Board#update_board. First reset
# it and then update it. Or simlpy update
# it.

# How ought board be updated when move
# amounts to a take en passant?

# Two possibilities: upwards movement
# or downwards movement. Note that the
# reference for the definition of upwards
# or downwards is no longer the initial
# pawn that opens up the possibility of take
# en-passant, but the pawn that is
# actualizing the take en-passant.

# Seemingly:
# âœ“ Update of Board#update_board.
# âœ“ Update of Board#valid_move?.
# âœ“ Update of game dynamic to reset a
#   possible board instance variable named
#   @possible_en_passant.

# However take en-passant isn't working
# at all in user experience of the game!...
# Seemingly due to problems around reading
# and setting of @en_passant.

# - Exchange of pieces.
# - Win statements logic does not apply.
# - Include check? clause into valid_move?

# Point to be worked on:
# - Pieces' exchange.

# Pieces' exchange calls for:
# - Additional conditional branch in
#   Board#valid_move?
# - Conditional branch that will have to
#   contemplate both player's pieces
#   distinctly.
# - Additional conditional branch in
#   Board#update_board.
# - Additional game dynamic surrounding
#   player's piece selection.

# But what is pieces' exchange exactly?

# Pawns that reach the last row of the board
# promote.

# When a player moves a pawn to the last row
# of the board, he replaces the pawn by a
# queen, rook, knight, or bishop (of the same
# color).

# It is not required that the pawn is promoted
# to a piece taken.

# Hence:
# Pawn promotion occurs when a pawn reaches
# its last row.

# For white pawns that will be row 8.
# For black pawns that will be row 1.

# Perhaps there is no need for a new
# conditional branch in Board#valid_move?.
# After all the move will have to be valid
# according to the standard criteria.

# What will have to be different is
# Board#update_board.
# As said before:
# - It will have to identify pawn promotion
#   for either side of the board.
# - It will have to update the board in
#   accordance to a selection from the
#   player.
# - And this last point: in a manner similar
#   to the default board update, but not
#   equal!

# Let us tackle the first side of the
# problem: pawn promotion identification.

# Pawn promotion:
# if pawn.colour == white and loc_end == x8
# if pawn.colour == black and loc_end == x1

def white_pawn_promotion?(idx_start_loc, end_loc)
  cells[idx_start_loc].is_a?(Pawn) &&
    cells[idx_start_loc].colour == "white" &&
      end_loc[1] == "8"
end

def black_pawn_promotion?(idx_start_loc, end_loc)
  cells[idx_start_loc].is_a?(Pawn) &&
    cells[idx_start_loc].colour == "black" &&
      end_loc[1] == "1"
end

def pawn_promotion?(idx_start_loc, end_loc)
  white_pawn_promotion?(idx_start_loc, end_loc) ||
    black_pawn_promotion?(idx_start_loc, end_loc)
end

# If pawn_promotion? turns out to be true,
# user input will have to determine to
# which piece the pawn will be promoted to.

# And this begs the question:
# What would be the best way to get desired
# user input?

# - Add a method to Board class that would
#   do the trick?
# - Or call on a method inherent to the
#   Game class?
# - Or allocate everything to a different
#   module?

# And be that as it may, what ought the user
# input to look like?
# Perhaps a simple input of the desired piece
# class' name, e.g. "queen".
# One could, moreover, easily accomodate
# capitalization on user input by calling
# #downcase on user input.

def valid_promotion_input?(promotion_input)
  %w[pawn rook knight bishop queen].include?(promotion_input.downcase)

# Verification that move that that ought to
# result in a pawn promotion is valid occurs
# as per normal, without any new conditional
# branch in Board#valid_move?.
# Within Board#update_board:
# - There will be a check for pawn promotions
#   for both players. This may result in the
#   addition of not one but two conditional
#   branches.
# - User input will be obtained as regards to
#   the desired replacement piece.
# - Board will be updated accordingly.

# As things now seem, only the last point
# is missing.

# How ought Board.cells be updated in the
# case of a pawn promotion?

# Formally:
# Set to nil start_loc.
# Set end_loc with replacement piece.
